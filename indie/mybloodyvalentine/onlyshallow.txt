Sleep
Like a pillow
No one there

(Where)
She won't care
Anyway (where)

Soft
As a pillow
Touch her there
Where she won't dare
Somewhere
Sleep
Like a (royal)
(Subject)

Think
That you grew
Stronger there

Speak
Your trouble(s)
She's not sc(ared)
Soft like there's silk
Everywhere
Sleep
(Is a) pillow
Come

Where she won't dare
Anyway (where)

(Look)
In the mirror
She's not there
Where she won't care
Somewhere
