Open up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
What to do with the remainder
When the dents
The dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time.

The world's an inventor with its work
Crawling, running, squirming 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths
The world's an inventor
We're the dirtiest thing its thought about
And we really don't mind

We'll probably never get there
Bring your sight seers, school teachers down
There's a water color weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds

The world composes with his
Shirt tails wrinkled hanging out
Bang us together see what sort
Of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of the mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about

We stole the road
We floated in the light
We're gonna break these bones
We're gonna move in time

We stole the road
We floated in the light
We're gonna break these bones
We're gonna travel time

We're gonna throw a party
All the ghosts of trees are coming out
Don't the open the directions
Wait until the light's inside of the cloud
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align

We stole the road
We floated in the light
We're gonna break these bones
We're gonna move in time

We stole the road
We floated in the light
We're gonna break these bones
We're gonna travel time

Close up the window
All the air all the air is falling out
