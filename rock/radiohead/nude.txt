Don't get any
Big ideas
They're not
Gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be
Something missing

Now that you've found it
It's gone
Now that you feel it
You don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any
Big ideas
They're not
Gonna happen

You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking
