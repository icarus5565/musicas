Shadow On The Sun
Audioslave

Once upon a time
I was of the mind to lay your burden down
And leave you where you stood
And you believed I could
You'd seen it done before

I could read your thoughts
Tell you what you saw and never say a word
But now all that is gone
Overwith and done
Never to return

I can tell you why
People die alone
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the Sun

Staring at the loss
Looking for a cause
And never really sure
Nothing but a hole
To live without a soul
And nothing to be learned

I can tell you why
People go insane!
I can show you how
You could do the same!

I can tell you why
The end will never come!
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the Sun!

Shapes of every size
Move behind my eyes
Doors inside my head
Bolted from within

Every drop of flame
Lights a candle in
Memory of the one
Who lives inside my skin

I can tell you why
People go insane!
I can show you how
You could do the same!

I can tell you why
The end will never come!
I can tell you I'm
A shadow on the Sun!

Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Shadow on the Sun!
Sun!
Sun!
