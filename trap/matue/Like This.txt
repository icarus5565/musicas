I think you might, might, might like this
Baby, your tone, I think you might, you might like this
Be worth your time, promise I'll do my best

Sittin' on my ass all day (yeah, oh)
Smokin', playin' silly games
Man, my life is such a waste
I've been inside this ill state
Stuck in my own mental cage
Oh, my life is just decay (ayy, ayy)
Sorry for my lack of confidence (oh)
I was searchin' for my heart again (oh, oh)
All these crushes in my heart again
I was lost, but now I'm found again
